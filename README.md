# Playtime with elm-spa-example

This repo is a clone of Richard Feldman's excellent https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example with some personal tweaks.

I'm learning the Elm SPA architecture by playing around with `elm-spa-example` and other libs that catch my eye.

## Playtime Roadmap so far

- [x] compile with parceljs
- [x] add tailwindcss v1 beta
- [x] replace # based routing
- [ ] replace bootstrap with tailwindcss (in progress)
